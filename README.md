# content-based-recommender


While following "Machine Learning with Python" course by IBM on Coursera, I decided to try this project.

Basically, content-based recommenders use the data which comes with the content. The recommender defines your taste with the input data and recommends you similar examples.

In this project, movie genres are our content indicators. We get some movie ratings from our user, then we'll try to recommend similar movies.
